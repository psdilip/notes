# DevOps


Software development - Use programming languages to develop applications

Dev Team
Developers team - coding (java, python)
Build team - (maven, gradle)
Testing Team - Testing (Junit, Selenium)

OpsTeam

System Team
Network Team
VM Team
Storage Team
Security Team


Challenge - there are silos within each team. Both teams dont know what other teams do. 
Every time we deliver product there are fights between each both teams.
OpsTeam dont know how to the application works
Dev teams dont know how to deployment process. Both teams are dependent on each other to deliver a product

We have to software development model
- Example - waterfall model
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Coding
    - Testing
    - Maintenance 
- Cons
    - Since its a linear approach
        - High amounts of risks
        - No working software
        - Not a good model for complex and objet oriented projects
        - Feedback path
        - Not flexible
Thus Agile Development Process came to life
	- People are given certain responsibilities
	- Specific timelines for release
	- Everyone follows stringent due dates
	- Specific timelines for features
	- So that testing/development/deployment happens fast
	- Every team member should understand the development process

- 3 - 4 releases per year
- Depends each organization or company
- Everyone needs to work in tandem

Agile methodology Limitations
	- Code works fine but fails in Delivery
	- Development Team wants change, but operations team wants stability
	- People will feel burden because it may result in extra work if anything goes wrong

DevOps
	- practice or process to integrate developers and operations teams for frequent releases and better productivity by automating infrastructure, workflows and measuring the application performances for continuous improvements
	- Practice that brings all these people together in much anticipated and expected way
	-  Both are working towards a certain goal
	- Heart of the organization
	- Still using Agile process to an extent
	- You need to deliver solid product meeting deadlines

DevOps Stages (list all the tools for each stage)
	- Source code Management
		- Maintain Different Versions of code
	- Continious build
		- Compile, validate, code review and testing
	- Cont Delivery
		- State where you have the flexibility to deploy at any point of time
	- Cont deployment
		- Completely automated
		- No manual intervention required
Process
	- Code commit 
	 - Build test
	- Jenkins
	- Deploy

DevOps - automated ci/cd pipelines

1. Code Commit (git)
2. Build (Jenkins)
3. Store Artifacts (Jfrog, Nexus)
4. Deploy (EC2, Kubernets, Docker)
5.
